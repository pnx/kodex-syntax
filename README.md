# Kodex syntax theme

Dark nice theme with smooth colors for Atom Editor.

### End-of-Life Notice

Becuase the atom project was [closed](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/) on December, 2022.

I have moved on to vs-code and stopped updates to this theme. The theme will still work, but no bug fixes or maintenance will be done. You are free to fork it if you want. Cheers.
